This repository was created to compare the two programs NeEstimator and SpeedNe. Both programs calculate the effective population size with linkage disequilibrium. 


############### the datasets: ############### 
Before starting calculations datasets should be saved in a folder called "datasets". We used 15 microsatellite datasets and 15 SNP datasets, which is 30 datasets in total. The datasets can be found ____ and downloaded from Dryad. We transformed all datasets in the same .xlsx format. The first column contains the name of the individual, the second column additional information on the population, collection point or country, etc. and the following columns contain information on the alleles. Diploid loci are written in several columns. Only the first column is labeled. A "." in the loci name can cause error messages. The column containing individuals and population is not labeled. The .xlsx sheet with the table you want to use should be called welcomeR.
